## Internal datapath components

Internally, qtcore-A1 will use the following registers:

1. Program Counter (PC): 5 bits - Stores the address of the next instruction to be executed. The reduced size is sufficient for addressing the 32-byte register memory (2^5 = 32).
2. Accumulator (ACC): 8 bits - Stores the result of arithmetic and logical operations, as well as acts as a temporary storage for addresses during certain operations (e.g., JSR instruction).
3. Instruction Register (IR): 8 bits - Stores the current instruction being executed.

Registers PC, ACC, and IR are instantiated using this shift register definition:
```
module shift_register #(
parameter WIDTH = 8
)(
input wire clk,
input wire rst,
input wire enable,
input wire [WIDTH-1:0] data_in,
output wire [WIDTH-1:0] data_out,
input wire scan_enable,
input wire scan_in,
output wire scan_out
);
```

Memory is instantiated using this definition:
```
module memory_bank #(
parameter ADDR_WIDTH = 5,
parameter DATA_WIDTH = 8,
parameter MEM_SIZE = 32
)(
input wire clk,
input wire rst,
input wire [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0] address,
input wire [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] data_in,
input wire write_enable,
output reg [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] data_out,
input wire scan_enable,
input wire scan_in,
output wire scan_out
);
```

The ALU is instantiated using this definition:
```
module alu (
input wire [7:0] A,
input wire [7:0] B,
input wire [3:0] opcode,
output reg [7:0] Y
);
```

When controlling the ALU:
| Opcode (4 bits) | Operation | Description |
|-----------------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| 0000 | ADD | Add: Y = A + B |
| 0001 | SUB | Subtract: Y = A - B |
| 0010 | AND | Bitwise AND: Y = A & B |
| 0011 | OR | Bitwise OR: Y = A \| B |
| 0100 | XOR | Bitwise XOR: Y = A ^ B |
| 0101 | SHL | Shift Left: Y = A << 1 |
| 0110 | SHR | Shift Right: Y = A >> 1 |
| 0111 | SHL4 | Shift Left by 4: Y = A << 4 |
| 1000 | ROL | Rotate Left: Y = {A[6:0], A[7]} |
| 1001 | ROR | Rotate Right: Y = {A[0], A[7:1]} |
| 1010 | DEC | Decrement: Y = A - 1 |
| 1011 | INV | Invert: Y = ~A |
| 1100 | CLR | Clear: Y = 0 |
| Others | Undefined | Default case (undefined operation) |
There is an embedded scan chain across all components.
The ordering is as as follows:
1. Control Unit (in: top level in)
2. Program Counter (PC) (in: control unit out)
3. Accumulator (ACC) (in: PC out)
4. Instruction Register (IR) (in: ACC out)
5. Memory Bank (in: IR out, out: top level out)

## Top level I/O:

The processor has the following I/O:
```
module qtcore_a1 (
input wire clk,
input wire rst,
input wire processor_enable,
input wire scan_enable,
input wire scan_in,
output wire scan_out,
output wire processor_halted
);
```

* CLR: ACC <- 0
* INV: ACC <- ~ACC

## Task:

Can you process the above specification and list each register and in terms of hardware components (e.g. PC, ALU etc), list possible component sources and destinations?

## ASSISTANT
Based on the provided specification, here is a list of each register along with their hardware components, and their possible sources and destinations:

1. Program Counter (PC):
   - Component: 5-bit register
   - Sources: Incremented PC, ACC (JMP, JSR), PC + 2 (BEQ_FWD, BNE_FWD), PC - 2 (BEQ_BWD, BNE_BWD)
   - Destinations: Memory address for instruction fetching

2. Accumulator (ACC):
   - Component: 8-bit register
   - Sources: ALU output, memory contents (LDA, LDAR), PC + 1 (JSR)
   - Destinations: ALU input, memory address or data (STA, JMP, JSR), condition checking (BEQ_FWD, BEQ_BWD, BNE_FWD, BNE_BWD)

3. Instruction Register (IR):
   - Component: 8-bit register
   - Sources: Memory contents at the address pointed to by PC
   - Destinations: Instruction decoder input

4. ALU:
   - Component: Arithmetic and Logic Unit
   - Sources: ACC (input A), immediate or memory content (input B), opcode from instruction decoder
   - Destinations: ACC

Possible component sources and destinations are as follows:

1. Memory Bank:
   - Sources: ACC (STA, LDAR)
   - Destinations: ACC (LDA, LDAR), IR (instruction fetching)

2. ALU:
   - Sources: ACC, memory contents (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR), immediate (ADDI)
   - Destinations: ACC

3. Control Unit:
   - Sources: IR (decoded instructions)
   - Destinations: PC (JMP, JSR, BEQ_FWD, BEQ_BWD, BNE_FWD, BNE_BWD), ACC (JSR), ALU (ALU operations)

## USER (#restarts:4)
Great start. However, we will be implementing a processor with multi-cycle execution, which changes the PC update values. What are the possible PC updates in the specification's "Multi-cycle execution"? 

## ASSISTANT
Apologies for the confusion earlier. In the context of multi-cycle execution for the given specification, the PC updates are as follows:

1. FETCH cycle (common to all instructions):
   - PC <- PC + 1

2. EXECUTE cycle:

   - JMP: PC <- ACC
   - JSR: ACC <- PC, PC <- ACC
   - BEQ_FWD: If ACC == 0, then PC <- PC + 2
   - BEQ_BWD: If ACC == 0, then PC <- PC - 2
   - BNE_FWD: If ACC != 0, then PC <- PC + 2
   - BNE_BWD: If ACC != 0, then PC <- PC - 2

For other instructions, the PC remains unchanged during the EXECUTE cycle, as they do not involve branching or jumps.

## USER
Can you check that again? I see different values in the specification.

## ASSISTANT
You are correct, and I apologize for the oversight. Here are the updated PC updates for the multi-cycle execution based on the provided specification:

1. FETCH cycle (common to all instructions):
   - PC <- PC + 1

2. EXECUTE cycle:

   - JMP: PC <- ACC
   - JSR: ACC <- PC, PC <- ACC
   - BEQ_FWD: If ACC == 0, then PC <- PC + 1
   - BEQ_BWD: If ACC == 0, then PC <- PC - 3
   - BNE_FWD: If ACC != 0, then PC <- PC + 1
   - BNE_BWD: If ACC != 0, then PC <- PC - 3

For other instructions, the PC remains unchanged during the EXECUTE cycle, as they do not involve branching or jumps.

## USER
Okay, good. So given this, can you re-do the list of registers and their possible sources and destinations?

## ASSISTANT
Certainly! Based on the provided specification and considering the multi-cycle execution, here is the updated list of each register along with their hardware components, and their possible sources and destinations:

1. Program Counter (PC):
   - Component: 5-bit register
   - Sources: Incremented PC (FETCH cycle), ACC (JMP, JSR), PC + 1 (BEQ_FWD, BNE_FWD), PC - 3 (BEQ_BWD, BNE_BWD)
   - Destinations: Memory address for instruction fetching

2. Accumulator (ACC):
   - Component: 8-bit register
   - Sources: ALU output, memory contents (LDA, LDAR), PC (JSR)
   - Destinations: ALU input, memory address or data (STA, JMP, JSR), condition checking (BEQ_FWD, BEQ_BWD, BNE_FWD, BNE_BWD)

3. Instruction Register (IR):
   - Component: 8-bit register
   - Sources: Memory contents at the address pointed to by PC
   - Destinations: Instruction decoder input

Possible component sources and destinations are as follows:

1. Memory Bank:
   - Sources: ACC (STA, LDAR)
   - Destinations: ACC (LDA, LDAR), IR (instruction fetching)

2. ALU:
   - Sources: ACC, memory contents (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR), immediate (ADDI)
   - Destinations: ACC

3. Control Unit:
   - Sources: IR (decoded instructions)
   - Destinations: PC (JMP, JSR, BEQ_FWD, BEQ_BWD, BNE_FWD, BNE_BWD), ACC (JSR), ALU (ALU operations)

## USER
Looks good! Can you now suggest a list of multiplexers that would be suitable for managing the inputs to these components? Provide source, destination, and control signal information.

## ASSISTANT
To manage the inputs to the components, you can use the following multiplexers:

1. Multiplexer for PC input:
   - Sources:
     - PC + 1 (FETCH cycle)
     - ACC (JMP, JSR)
     - PC + 1 (BEQ_FWD, BNE_FWD)
     - PC - 3 (BEQ_BWD, BNE_BWD)
   - Destination: PC input
   - Control Signals: 2-bit control signal from the control unit indicating which source should be selected (00: PC + 1, 01: ACC, 10: PC + 1, 11: PC - 3)

2. Multiplexer for ACC input:
   - Sources:
     - ALU output
     - Memory contents (LDA, LDAR)
     - PC (JSR)
   - Destination: ACC input
   - Control Signals: 2-bit control signal from the control unit indicating which source should be selected (00: ALU, 01: Memory, 10: PC)

3. Multiplexer for ALU input B:
   - Sources:
     - Memory contents (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR)
     - Immediate (ADDI)
   - Destination: ALU input B
   - Control Signals: 1-bit control signal from the control unit indicating which source should be selected (0: Memory, 1: Immediate)

4. Multiplexer for memory address input (when needed for LDA, STA, ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, LDAR):
   - Sources:
     - IR[4:0] (LDA, STA, ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR)
     - ACC (LDAR)
   - Destination: Memory address input
   - Control Signals: 1-bit control signal from the control unit indicating which source should be selected (0: IR[4:0], 1: ACC)

These multiplexers, controlled by the control unit, will help manage the flow of data between the components based on the instruction being executed.

## USER
I think the memory address input multiplexer might also need one more input - so we can load instructions from it!

## ASSISTANT
You are correct. The memory address input multiplexer should also include an input for loading instructions. Here's the updated multiplexer:

4. Multiplexer for memory address input:
   - Sources:
     - IR[4:0] (LDA, STA, ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR)
     - ACC (LDAR)
     - PC (Instruction fetching)
   - Destination: Memory address input
   - Control Signals: 2-bit control signal from the control unit indicating which source should be selected (00: IR[4:0], 01: ACC, 10: PC)

This updated multiplexer will allow you to fetch instructions from memory using the PC value as the address input.

## USER (#restarts:2)
Looks excellent. Assuming the multiplexers are provided as you described, can you now provide a list of control signals that are needed for each register and the memory unit? Include the multiplexer control signals you described above to associate them with each register.

## ASSISTANT
Considering the multiplexers provided above and the required control signals for each register and the memory unit, here is a list of control signals:

1. Program Counter (PC):
   - PC_mux_select (2 bits): Control signal for the PC input multiplexer.
     - 00: PC + 1 (FETCH cycle)
     - 01: ACC (JMP, JSR)
     - 10: PC + 1 (BEQ_FWD, BNE_FWD)
     - 11: PC - 3 (BEQ_BWD, BNE_BWD)

2. Accumulator (ACC):
   - ACC_mux_select (2 bits): Control signal for the ACC input multiplexer.
     - 00: ALU output
     - 01: Memory contents (LDA, LDAR)
     - 10: PC (JSR)

3. Instruction Register (IR):
   - IR_load_enable (1 bit): Control signal to enable loading new instruction into IR from memory.

4. ALU:
   - ALU_opcode (4 bits): Control signal specifying the ALU operation to perform.
   - ALU_inputB_mux_select (1 bit): Control signal for the ALU input B multiplexer.
     - 0: Memory contents (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR)
     - 1: Immediate (ADDI)

5. Memory Unit:
   - Memory_address_mux_select (2 bits): Control signal for the memory address input multiplexer.
     - 00: IR[4:0] (LDA, STA, ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR)
     - 01: ACC (LDAR)
     - 10: PC (Instruction fetching)
   - Memory_write_enable (1 bit): Control signal to enable writing to memory (STA).

The control signals above are generated by the control unit based on the decoded instruction and the current execution cycle (FETCH or EXECUTE). They help manage the flow of data between the components and perform the desired operations.

## USER
Given that the PC and ACC are also registers, might they also need a write signal?

## ASSISTANT
You're correct. Both the PC and ACC registers should have write enable signals to control when they should be updated. Here's the updated list of control signals including the write enable signals for PC and ACC:

1. Program Counter (PC):
   - PC_mux_select (2 bits): Control signal for the PC input multiplexer.
     - 00: PC + 1 (FETCH cycle)
     - 01: ACC (JMP, JSR)
     - 10: PC + 1 (BEQ_FWD, BNE_FWD)
     - 11: PC - 3 (BEQ_BWD, BNE_BWD)
   - PC_write_enable (1 bit): Control signal to enable updating the PC value.

2. Accumulator (ACC):
   - ACC_mux_select (2 bits): Control signal for the ACC input multiplexer.
     - 00: ALU output
     - 01: Memory contents (LDA, LDAR)
     - 10: PC (JSR)
   - ACC_write_enable (1 bit): Control signal to enable updating the ACC value.

3. Instruction Register (IR):
   - IR_load_enable (1 bit): Control signal to enable loading new instruction into IR from memory.

4. ALU:
   - ALU_opcode (4 bits): Control signal specifying the ALU operation to perform.
   - ALU_inputB_mux_select (1 bit): Control signal for the ALU input B multiplexer.
     - 0: Memory contents (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR)
     - 1: Immediate (ADDI)

5. Memory Unit:
   - Memory_address_mux_select (2 bits): Control signal for the memory address input multiplexer.
     - 00: IR[4:0] (LDA, STA, ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR)
     - 01: ACC (LDAR)
     - 10: PC (Instruction fetching)
   - Memory_write_enable (1 bit): Control signal to enable writing to memory (STA).

The write enable signals for PC and ACC ensure that their values are only updated when required by the current instruction and execution cycle.

## USER (#restarts:2)
One optimization - It looks like the PC has two options that are both PC + 1 - can we simplify?

## ASSISTANT
Yes, you're right. We can simplify the control signals for the PC input multiplexer since two options have the same value (PC + 1). Here's the updated list of control signals with the simplified PC_mux_select:

1. Program Counter (PC):
   - PC_mux_select (2 bits): Control signal for the PC input multiplexer.
     - 00: PC + 1 (FETCH cycle, BEQ_FWD, BNE_FWD)
     - 01: ACC (JMP, JSR)
     - 10: PC - 3 (BEQ_BWD, BNE_BWD)
   - PC_write_enable (1 bit): Control signal to enable updating the PC value.

2. Accumulator (ACC):
   - ACC_mux_select (2 bits): Control signal for the ACC input multiplexer.
     - 00: ALU output
     - 01: Memory contents (LDA, LDAR)
     - 10: PC (JSR)
   - ACC_write_enable (1 bit): Control signal to enable updating the ACC value.

3. Instruction Register (IR):
   - IR_load_enable (1 bit): Control signal to enable loading new instruction into IR from memory.

4. ALU:
   - ALU_opcode (4 bits): Control signal specifying the ALU operation to perform.
   - ALU_inputB_mux_select (1 bit): Control signal for the ALU input B multiplexer.
     - 0: Memory contents (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR)
     - 1: Immediate (ADDI)

5. Memory Unit:
   - Memory_address_mux_select (2 bits): Control signal for the memory address input multiplexer.
     - 00: IR[4:0] (LDA, STA, ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR)
     - 01: ACC (LDAR)
     - 10: PC (Instruction fetching)
   - Memory_write_enable (1 bit): Control signal to enable writing to memory (STA).

By simplifying the PC_mux_select, we have reduced the complexity of the control logic while still achieving the desired behavior for the PC updates.

## USER (#restarts:10)
This looks excellent. According to this list, please produce the module definition for a control unit in Verilog which could operate the processor datapath. Please comment the purpose of each I/O. If a signal is for controlling a multiplexer, please also comment what each possible value should correspond to in the datapath.

## ASSISTANT
Here's the Verilog module definition for the control unit that can operate the processor datapath:

```verilog
module control_unit (
    input wire clk,                // Clock input
    input wire rst,                // Reset input
    input wire [7:0] instruction,  // Input from the Instruction Register (IR)

    output wire PC_write_enable,   // Enables writing to the PC
    output wire [1:0] PC_mux_select, // Selects the input for the PC multiplexer
                                     // 00: PC + 1 (FETCH cycle, BEQ_FWD, BNE_FWD)
                                     // 01: ACC (JMP, JSR)
                                     // 10: PC - 3 (BEQ_BWD, BNE_BWD)

    output wire ACC_write_enable,  // Enables writing to the ACC
    output wire [1:0] ACC_mux_select, // Selects the input for the ACC multiplexer
                                      // 00: ALU output
                                      // 01: Memory contents (LDA, LDAR)
                                      // 10: PC (JSR)

    output wire IR_load_enable,    // Enables loading new instruction into IR from memory

    output wire [3:0] ALU_opcode,  // Control signal specifying the ALU operation
    output wire ALU_inputB_mux_select, // Selects input B for the ALU multiplexer
                                       // 0: Memory contents (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR)
                                       // 1: Immediate (ADDI)

    output wire Memory_write_enable, // Enables writing to memory (STA)
    output wire [1:0] Memory_address_mux_select // Selects input for memory address multiplexer
                                                // 00: IR[4:0] (LDA, STA, ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR)
                                                // 01: ACC (LDAR)
                                                // 10: PC (Instruction fetching)
);
// Control logic implementation goes here
endmodule
```

This module definition includes all the control signals required to manage the processor's datapath components, including the multiplexer control signals and the signals to enable writing to the registers and memory. The actual control logic implementation is not provided here but would be designed based on the instruction set and desired processor behavior.

## USER (#restarts:1)
Might the control unit need more inputs for the branching inputs? How should it decide to enable the branch mux?

## ASSISTANT
Yes, you're right. The control unit should take additional inputs for branching. It will need the Accumulator (ACC) value and the Zero Flag (ZF) as inputs to make a decision on whether to enable the branch multiplexer. We can modify the control unit module definition as follows:

```verilog
module control_unit (
    input wire clk,                // Clock input
    input wire rst,                // Reset input
    input wire [7:0] instruction,  // Input from the Instruction Register (IR)
    input wire [7:0] ACC_value,    // Input from the Accumulator (ACC)
    input wire ZF,                 // Zero Flag input, true when ACC is zero

    output wire PC_write_enable,   // Enables writing to the PC
    output wire [1:0] PC_mux_select, // Selects the input for the PC multiplexer
                                     // 00: PC + 1 (FETCH cycle, BEQ_FWD, BNE_FWD)
                                     // 01: ACC (JMP, JSR)

The control unit can now decide whether to enable the branch multiplexer based on the instruction, the ACC value, and the Zero Flag (ZF). For example, if the instruction is BEQ_FWD (branch if equal, forward) and the Zero Flag (ZF) is true, the control unit will enable the branch multiplexer and select PC + 1 as the next program counter value. The control logic implementation should be updated to include these branching conditions.

## USER
Does it need the whole ACC value if it has the ACC is Zero flag?

## ASSISTANT
You're right. The control unit doesn't need the whole ACC value if it already has the Zero Flag (ZF) as input. The Zero Flag (ZF) alone should be sufficient to make branching decisions. We can modify the control unit module definition accordingly:

```verilog
module control_unit (
    input wire clk,                // Clock input
    input wire rst,                // Reset input
    input wire [7:0] instruction,  // Input from the Instruction Register (IR)
    input wire ZF,                 // Zero Flag input, true when ACC is zero

    output wire PC_write_enable,   // Enables writing to the PC
    output wire [1:0] PC_mux_select, // Selects the input for the PC multiplexer
                                     // 00: PC + 1 (FETCH cycle, BEQ_FWD, BNE_FWD)
                                     // 01: ACC (JMP, JSR)
                                     // 10: PC - 3 (BEQ_BWD, BNE_BWD)

    output wire ACC_write_enable,  // Enables writing to the ACC
    output wire [1:0] ACC_mux_select, // Selects the input for the ACC multiplexer
                                      // 00: ALU output
                                      // 01: Memory contents (LDA, LDAR)
                                      // 10: PC (JSR)

    output wire IR_load_enable,    // Enables loading new instruction into IR from memory

    output wire [3:0] ALU_opcode,  // Control signal specifying the ALU operation
    output wire ALU_inputB_mux_select, // Selects input B for the ALU multiplexer
                                       // 0: Memory contents (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR)
                                       // 1: Immediate (ADDI)

    output wire Memory_write_enable, // Enables writing to memory (STA)
    output wire [1:0] Memory_address_mux_select // Selects input for memory address multiplexer
                                                // 00: IR[4:0] (LDA, STA, ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR)
                                                // 01: ACC (LDAR)
                                                // 10: PC (Instruction fetching)
);
// Control logic implementation goes here
endmodule
```

Now the control unit takes only the Zero Flag (ZF) as input and can make branching decisions based on it. The control logic implementation should still be updated to include these branching conditions.

## USER
Looks great - can you now add the scan chain signals to the control unit, as well as two other signals - one for processor enable and one output for processor halted?

## ASSISTANT
Of course! Here's the updated control unit module definition with the scan chain signals, processor enable, and processor halted signals:

```verilog
module control_unit (
    input wire clk,                // Clock input
    input wire rst,                // Reset input
    input wire processor_enable,   // Processor enable signal
    output wire processor_halted,  // Processor halted signal
    input wire [7:0] instruction,  // Input from the Instruction Register (IR)
    input wire ZF,                 // Zero Flag input, true when ACC is zero

    output wire PC_write_enable,   // Enables writing to the PC
    output wire [1:0] PC_mux_select, // Selects the input for the PC multiplexer
                                     // 00: PC + 1 (FETCH cycle, BEQ_FWD, BNE_FWD)
                                     // 01: ACC (JMP, JSR)
                                     // 10: PC - 3 (BEQ_BWD, BNE_BWD)

    output wire ACC_write_enable,  // Enables writing to the ACC
    output wire [1:0] ACC_mux_select, // Selects the input for the ACC multiplexer
                                      // 00: ALU output
                                      // 01: Memory contents (LDA, LDAR)
                                      // 10: PC (JSR)

    output wire IR_load_enable,    // Enables loading new instruction into IR from memory

    output wire [3:0] ALU_opcode,  // Control signal specifying the ALU operation
    output wire ALU_inputB_mux_select, // Selects input B for the ALU multiplexer
                                       // 0: Memory contents (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR)
                                       // 1: Immediate (ADDI)

    output wire Memory_write_enable, // Enables writing to memory (STA)
    output wire [1:0] Memory_address_mux_select, // Selects input for memory address multiplexer
                                                 // 00: IR[4:0] (LDA, STA, ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR)
                                                 // 01: ACC (LDAR)
                                                 // 10: PC (Instruction fetching)

    // Scan chain signals
    input wire scan_enable,        // Scan chain enable signal
    input wire scan_in,            // Scan chain input
    output wire scan_out           // Scan chain output
);
// Control logic implementation goes here
endmodule
```

Now the control unit has inputs for the scan chain signals `scan_enable`, `scan_in`, and `scan_out`, as well as an input for `processor_enable` and an output for `processor_halted`.
